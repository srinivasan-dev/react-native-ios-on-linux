# How to Develop iOS Apps on Linux

This repo demonstrates how to develop a React Native iOS app from Linux.

The approach we take is to make an iOS app configurable to use different React Native packagers, so that we can point it to a packager running on Linux.

This accompanies an article on the subject, [How to Develop iOS Apps on Linux using React Native](http://www.proreactnative.com/How-to-Develop-iOS-Apps-on-Linux-Using-React-Native/).

Please try it out and let me know how it goes!
